# Final-Project

This website is a Pet Feeding Tracker. 

Users will be able to sign up and sign in to this website, and add a pet of their choice.

They will be given the option to add a name and the species of the animal. Additionally, they will be able to choose a feeding frequency.

The feeding frequency options are: Once a day, Once every other day, Once a week, Once every 2 weeks, Once a month. 

Each pet will be displayed on a card on the website's home page which is called "Beastiary". 

There, users will be able to click on their pet's card which will redirect them to a page with more information on their pet.

In this page, there will be an update, remove, and feed button. 

The first two buttons function as they sound. The feed button will update a Last Fed entry which will update the website with the time the pet was "Fed".

This time will be displayed of course, and will stay there until the feed button is pressed again. 

In this page there is also a bar that acts as a "Heatlh Bar". This bar will turn red if a number of days has passed since the button was pressed.

It will turn green if the pet is fed within the required timeframe.
